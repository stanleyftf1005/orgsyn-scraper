The mixture is refluxed (Note 3) in order to convert the alcohol as completely as possible into the corresponding bromide, and the latter is then removed from the reaction mixture by distillation. The water-insoluble layer is separated; washed successively with water, cold concentrated sulfuric acid (Note 4), and a sodium carbonate solution; separated; dried with calcium chloride (Note 5); and distilled. Slight variations from this procedure depend upon the physical and chemical properties of the alcohol used, or of the bromide formed in the reaction. For example, in the preparations of ethyl and allyl bromides, the reaction mixture is not refluxed because of the volatility of the former compound, and because of the chemical reactivity of the latter; in the preparation of iso-amyl bromide, too large a proportion of sulfuric acid may produce appreciable decomposition, whereas halides of high molecular weight, because of their low volatility, are separated from the reaction mixture mechanically, instead of by distillation.', 'The use of a modified sodium bromide-sulfuric acid method (Note 6) for the preparation of alkyl bromides is described in connection with the preparation of n-butyl bromide. This method has been used also for the preparations of iso-amyl and trimethylene bromides, but, in general, the yields were found to be somewhat lower than those obtained with the hydrobromic-sulfuric acid method.']}, {'id': 'Route 2', 'steppara': ['Preparation of Hydrobromic Acid.—Hydrobromic acid may be prepared conveniently by the interaction of bromine and sulfur dioxide in the presence of water1 (Note 7).', 'In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 1200 g. (377 cc., 7.5 moles) of bromine, 500 cc. of water, and 1500 g. of crushed ice. A fairly rapid stream of sulfur dioxide is allowed to pass from a pressure tank into the flask, the outlet of the gas-tube being placed below the surface of the bromine layer. The flow of sulfur dioxide is adjusted at such a rate that the gas is completely absorbed. It is advisable to agitate the mixture occasionally during the first stage of the reduction (Note 8). About two hours will serve for the completion of the reduction, at which time the mixture will assume a yellow color (Note 9) which is not removed by further addition of sulfur dioxide, an excess of which is to be avoided (Note 10). To prevent loss by gaseous hydrogen bromide, it is advisable to cool the mixture during the progress of the reduction.', 'When the reduction is completed, the flask is connected with a condenser and the mixture subjected to distillation. The boiling point of constant boiling hydrobromic acid is 125–126° /760 mm., but it must be remembered that, in distilling the product from the sulfuric acid mixture, the thermometer reading should not be relied upon as an index to the composition of the distillate. Towards the end of the distillation the thermometer may rise to 130° and above, when water with only traces of acid distils from the sulfuric acid residue. Upon redistillation of the product the thermometer reading may be relied upon. For many uses a product free from traces of sulfuric acid is not required and one distillation is sufficient. In such cases the progress of the distillation is followed by determinations of the specific gravity of the distillate.', 'According to the above procedure, 20 kg. of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid (92 per cent of the theoretical amount) may be prepared from 10.3 kg. of bromine. The actual time required by one person for the preparation of this quantity is twenty-three hours.', 'For the preparation of alkyl bromides on a relatively large scale the hydrobromic acid need not be distilled but may be used directly for the subsequent preparation. The fact that 0.5 mole of sulfuric acid is present for each mole of hydrobromic acid is not a disadvantage, since the presence of sulfuric acid is desired, and consequently a correspondingly smaller quantity need be added.']}, {'id': 'Route 3', 'steppara': ['In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, a hydrobromic acid solution is prepared (p. 26) by the sulfur dioxide reduction of 480 g.

Since such a vessel is often not available in the average laboratory, directions are also included using an ordinary can (A), although in such cases the yields are much lower, and relatively smaller quantities of materials are used.', '(A) Preparation in Tin Vessel.—In a large dish pan, 1900 g. (6.4 moles) of No. AAA castor oil (Note 1) is treated with occasional stirring with a solution of 500 g. (12.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 300 cc. of water. A reaction takes place, some heat is developed, and within ten or fifteen minutes a very hard solid soap is produced. This soap is broken up into small pieces and placed in a 3-gallon (12-l.) can (Note 2). In this preparation, a petroleum ether can was used, but any kind available would be just as satisfactory. The container is now fitted with an efficient reflux condenser, and it is then heated over a ring burner as long as hydrogen is evolved. The heating is regulated to produce a fairly rapid evolution of gas as shown by leading a tube from the top of the condenser into a small beaker of water. The time required for the complete evolution of the hydrogen is about nine to ten hours.', 'If the above reaction is not completed at one time and intermediate cooling is allowed, the reaction mixture sets to a solid mass and certain precautions must be taken before proceeding further. Either before heating is renewed the mass must be punched full of holes by means of an iron rod, or when the heating is started care must be taken to heat the upper part of the can first and gradually to approach the bottom. If the under part of the solid soap were heated directly, it would decompose before the upper part, and the hydrogen, being unable to escape, would cause the can to burst.', 'The condenser is now set downward for distillation and the heating is continued. If intermediate cooling is allowed, one of the precautions mentioned above must be observed before starting the distillation. The alcohol distils over with the water and is separated from time to time, the water being returned to the distillation can by means of a separatory funnel inserted through a rubber stopper in the top of the can. The addition of this water must be very slow in order to prevent foaming (Note 3). The heating should be regulated so that the distillate is coming over in rapid drops, not in a stream. If desired, the same sort of gravity separator described below under the large-sized experiment (B) may be used in this small run. About twelve hours are required for this distillation (Note 4). Toward the end, high-boiling products are obtained and considerable gas is liberated. Difficulty is almost always encountered during this part of the preparation because the long heating causes the solder in the bottom edge of the can to melt and leaks thus develop which allow a certain amount of soap to run out. The distillation need not be stopped, because the soap fills the holes, but under these conditions the temperature cannot be maintained at a point high enough for the complete distillation without material loss from increased leakage. The upper layer of crude alcohol is separated from the water and fractionated. The portion boiling from 100–120° is chiefly water with a little alcohol in it. The second fraction between 120° and 175° contains a considerable quantity of ketones along with the alcohol (Note 4). The main portion distilling between 175° and 185° is the methylhexylcarbinol. Upon refractionation,\r\r\r\n190–200 g. (23–25 per cent of the theoretical amount) of alcohol boiling at 175–180° is obtained.', 'This product is satisfactory for most purposes. If, however, a very pure product is desired, this may be made by shaking carefully the alcohol with 15 per cent sodium bisulfite solution, separating the alcohol, and steam distilling it from alkaline solution. The alcohol is finally distilled, and the fraction boiling at 177–179° is collected. If saturated sodium bisulfite is employed, a crystalline material which contains alcohol is formed and causes difficulty in the separation (Note 5).', 'Two runs of 6 kg. of castor oil with the same relative proportions of alkali and water were made in 8-gallon (30-l.) cans. The yields of pure alcohol were 650 g. and 730 g.

This allows the alcohol to run off into a receiver and the heavier aqueous layer to return through a separatory funnel to the copper kettle. A few essential points in the apparatus should be indicated: it is necessary that the return arm of the gravity separator be below the tube through which the alcohol flows into the receiver; the lower end of the funnel must be below the return side arm in order to prevent water being carried along with the methylhexylcarbinol; the capillaries A and B are necessary to prevent siphoning in the respective tubes.', 'A soap is made as already described (A) from 11.2 kg. (37.6 moles) of No. AAA castor oil (Note 1) and 2900 g. (73 moles of sodium hydroxide in 5800 g. of water (Note 7). This is broken up, placed in the kettle, and gradually heated. Much gas is evolved, and care should be taken not to lose alcohol, particularly at the beginning. The separator is not adjusted and the stopcock of the separatory funnel is kept closed until about 3 l. of distillate is collected; any small amount of alcohol is separated and the water discarded (Note 7). The separator is now put in place to return the water to the kettle. The separatory funnel is allowed to fill with liquid and then the stopcock regulated so that the liquid flows back to the copper vessel as fast as it distils over. A return tube similar to the one illustrated in Fig. 22, p. 422, may be used, but in making methylhexylcarbinol the separatory funnel has the advantage that, if foaming occurs in the reaction flask, further addition of water can be immediately and easily stopped (Note 3).', 'The distillation is continued until no more alcohol comes over, a process which requires forty-eight to seventy-two hours of continuous heating. Superheating must be avoided, since foaming will then occur and may cause considerable difficulty. It is therefore advisable to adjust the heating so that the distillate comes over in rapid drops but not in a stream. If cooling is allowed to take place before the distillation is complete, it is advisable to break up the reaction cake before heating again, or to start the heating at the top of the cake and to approach the bottom gradually (Note 8). The crude product obtained is very much lighter in color than that produced when cans are used (A), and when it is distilled only very small fractions of low- or high-boiling material result. Moreover, the amount of ketones is small. The yields of the redistilled fraction boiling at 175–180° in three successive experiments were 1854 g., 1955 g., and 1894 g. (40–42 per cent of the theoretical amount), quantities about twice those obtained when cans are used (A). The time that one actually devotes to the production of methylhexylcarbinol is not great, but the total time necessary for carrying out a large experiment is almost a week.']}]"

To obtain from this crude reaction mixture a water or alcohol solution of trimethylamine, it is not satisfactory merely to treat with alkali and lead the trimethylamine through the solvent, since the gas is inefficiently absorbed; in fact, it is almost impossible to get a concentrated solution in this way without loss of material. The best way to prepare a solution is to liquefy the trimethylamine (b.p. 3.5°) and in this form run it into the solvent. For this purpose, the 5-l. flask in which the initial reaction is carried out is fitted with a rubber stopper holding a separatory funnel and a glass tube for leading off the trimethylamine (Note 1).

By means of an oil bath, the temperature of the reaction mixture is gradually raised. Between 85° and 105° liquefaction begins to take place at the bottom of the flask, and at the same time a very vigorous evolution of carbon dioxide starts. The heat is at once withdrawn, and if the reaction is too violent, the oil bath should be removed. The reaction is allowed to continue without further heating until the gas evolution is less vigorous. This requires about one and one-half hours. Heat is again applied and the temperature of the bath raised to about 160°, where it is held until there is practically no more evolution of carbon dioxide. This takes two and one-half to three and one-half hours, after which time the reaction is complete.', 'To obtain the trimethylamine hydrochloride, it is now merely necessary to treat the mixture with sodium hydroxide, and to distil the free amine into hydrochloric acid. A separatory funnel is therefore inserted through the stopper of the flask and the reflux condenser is changed to a downward position for distillation. The open end of the condenser is fitted tightly into the neck of a distilling flask or suction flask, to the outside arm of which is attached, by means of rubber tubing, a glass tube which leads under hydrochloric acid in a receiver. Care must be taken to have all the joints in the apparatus tight as the trimethylamine is very volatile and can easily be lost. The object of the intermediate boiling or suction flask is to catch any water which may distil with the trimethylamine during the treatment with the sodium hydroxide. This water is often colored yellow, and if allowed to go directly into the hydrochloric acid in the receiver contaminates the trimethylamine hydrochloride.', 'A solution of 1100 g. of sodium hydroxide (two and one-half to three times the amount theoretically necessary to liberate the free amine) in 2 l. of water is allowed to drop through the separatory funnel into the reaction mixture, which has cooled somewhat during the change of apparatus. The amine distils, passes through the condenser, through the intermediate bottle, and into the receiver, in which is placed an amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid (930 cc. of sp. gr. 1.19) slightly more than enough to neutralize the weight of amine which should theoretically be formed. To be certain that all the amine has been driven from the reaction flask, heat is finally applied for ten or fifteen minutes to the mixture. The whole procedure, from the beginning of the first reaction until a solution of trimethylamine hydrochloride is obtained, requires not more than six to seven hours.', 'To obtain the trimethylamine hydrochloride, the hydrochloric acid solution is evaporated, first over a free flame, and later, when the crystals start to form, on a steam bath. As the solution gets more and more concentrated, the trimethylamine hydrochloride crystallizes out and is filtered from time to time, dried for a few minutes in an air bath (temperature 100–110°), and then kept in a tightly closed bottle. If the trimethylamine hydrochloride as it crystallizes is centrifuged, the product is obtained pure and dry at once. The average yield from four runs is 710 g. of pure trimethylamine hydrochloride and 82 g. of product which is tinged slightly yellow (a total of 89 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the ammonium chloride) (Note 2). The coloration results from the evaporation to dryness of the very last portion of solution.']}]"

Just enough sodium hydroxide solution is then added, with stirring, to cause the mixture to have a distinct odor of dimethylaniline (about 240 cc. of a 40 per cent solution is generally required), and the mixture is allowed to stand for forty-eight hours or longer at room temperature (20–25°) (Note 5).', 'The solid is then filtered off, washed first with water, then with 400 cc. of 10 per cent acetic acid (to remove the dimethylaniline), and finally with distilled water.

The solid product is washed with a second 4 l. of cold methyl alcohol (Note 6). After being dried in air, it varies in weight from 820 to 870 g.', 'The product is extracted with boiling toluene in the following manner: 150 g. is placed in a fluted filter paper of 29-cm. diameter in a 25-cm. glass funnel which passes through the cork of a 2-l. flat-bottomed conical flask containing 1250 cc. of toluene (Fig. 21).\n\nFig. 21.\n\n\n\n\n\r\r\r\nThe flask is heated on an electric stove, and a 12-l. round-bottomed flask, clamped to a ring stand, is placed on the funnel to act as a condenser, cold water being run through the flask. The toluene is boiled until the condensed liquid runs through almost colorless (this requires from four to ten hours). The heating is then discontinued, and, as soon as the liquid ceases to boil, the flask is removed to a bath containing water at 90–100°; the level of the water should be slightly above the level of the liquid in the flask. This arrangement permits the temperature to fall slowly so that large crystals are obtained. In the meantime a second conical flask containing 1250 cc. of toluene is attached to the funnel, and a new charge of 150 g. of crude methyl red is placed in the paper. The process is repeated until all the crude material has been so treated. When extraction is complete it is found that a certain amount of black amorphous insoluble matter remains on the filter; this is discarded. The crystals of methyl red (Note 7) are filtered off and washed with a little toluene. The weight of pure material is 755–805 g. The mother liquors are concentrated to one-fourth of their volume, and the crystals which separate on cooling are recrystallized from fresh toluene. The recovered toluene can, of course, be employed again. The total yield of pure methyl red is 790–840 g. (62–66 per cent of the theoretical amount) (Note 8). It melts at 181–182°.', 'The watery mother liquors from the crude methyl red are rendered alkaline with sodium hydroxide and distilled until no more dimethylaniline passes over.

The receiver should be so arranged that it can be cooled, if necessary, by a stream of water.', 'The solution is heated slowly until the first appearance of bubbles of carbon dioxide, which occurs when the temperature has reached about 80°. The flame is then removed and the reaction allowed to proceed by itself (Note 2). If no rise in temperature occurs, heat is very cautiously applied until the temperature rises to 85°, when the flame is again removed (Note 3). At this temperature the exothermic decomposition of the sodium nitroacetate becomes so rapid that the temperature rises almost to 100° without further application of external heat. If heat is applied after the temperature of the liquid reaches 85°, violent frothing will occur, with serious loss of nitromethane. If the reaction becomes too vigorous it may be checked by applying a wet towel to the flask. Nitromethane starts to distil over at about 90°. During the spontaneous heating, about 120 cc. of nitromethane distils over, accompanied by about 170 cc. of water (Note 4). This water is saved for redistillation.', 'When the mixture ceases to maintain its temperature spontaneously at 95–100°, heat is applied cautiously until the temperature reaches 110°. About 13 cc. of nitromethane and 200 cc. of water distil over. Further distillation gives water which contains too little nitromethane to pay for recovery. At this point enough sodium chloride and sodium carbonate have separated to cause serious bumping.', 'The water separated from the nitromethane distillates is mixed with one-fourth of its weight of salt, and redistilled, yielding 10–12 cc. of nitromethane and about 100 cc. of water. This water on distillation gives 3–4 cc. of nitromethane and about 45 cc. of water (Note 5).', 'The total yield of moist product is 125–135 g.; on drying with a little calcium chloride and distilling, 115–125 g. of pure nitromethane, boiling at 98–101°, is obtained (35–38 per cent of the theoretical amount).
